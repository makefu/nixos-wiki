= A cheat sheet and rough mapping between Ubuntu and NixOS =
This is meant to give you basic ideas and get you unstuck. NixOS being very different from most distributions, a deeper understanding will be necessary sooner or later! Follow the links to the manual pages and browse the wiki to find real NixOS tutorials.

The system-wide column is the equivalent of using apt under Ubuntu.

TODO Provide well-commented sample configuration.nix and ~/.nixpkgs/config.nix files with examples of common tasks.

|This column will let you do everything you can with Ubuntu and more.	
|This column just isn't possible in Ubuntu.
|-
|Who can install packages and who can run them?
|All packages are always system-wide and only root can install packages.
|Packages root installs are system-wide. It does so through through /etc/nixos/configuration.nix. If root installs packages the same way users do, through ~/.nixpkgs/config.nix, they are also global. Root's default profile is the system-wide default profile.
|Users can install their own packages and have their own profiles (environments) through ~/.nixpkgs/config.nix
|-
|Package manager
|apt which is really running on top of dpkg, sometimes wrapped by UIs like aptitude.
|nix, but many system-wide operations are provided by nixos packages.
|Just nix without the involvement of nixos.
|-
|How do you select your official sources and major releases
|These are baked into the distribution (e.g. Ubuntu version X). Upgrades are hard and permanent.
|At any time you select from a collection of channels. They're system-wide when set by root. You can roll back changes or switch channels with ease.
|Channels are per-user if they're not set by root.
|-
|Where are packages installed?
|apt installs globally into /bin/, /usr/, etc.	
|System-wide packages are in /run/current-system/sw/ (these are installed because of /etc/nixos/configuration.nix) and /nix/var/nix/profiles/default/bin/ (this is the profile managed by root). Note that the files are just symlinks to the real packages managed by nix /nix/store/.
|User packages are in ~/.nix-profile/. Note that the files are just symlinks to the real packages managed by nix in /nix/store/.
|-
|When changes take effect
|As soon as the command runs. Commands are not atomic and can leave your machine in a bad state.
|Most of the time you modify the configuration file and apply changes with nixos-rebuild switch
TODO How does one get nixos to do all the work for a switch and separate out the actual switching from fetching/building?
|Most of the time you apply changes with nix-env -i all

|Install a package
|<pre>sudo apt-get install emacs</pre>

If it's a program add to systemPackages:
<pre>
 systemPackages = with pkgs; 
                    [ <other packages...> emacs ];</pre>
If it's a service add:

<pre>services.openssh.enable = true;</pre>
|<pre>nix-env -i emacs</pre>
Or with collections, add the package to your ~/.nixpkgs/config.nix and run
<pre>nix-env -i all</pre>

|<pre>nix-channel --add\

Add the unstable channel. At that address you will find names for other versions and variants. Name can be any string.

To eliminate a channel.
<pre>nix-channel --list</pre>
To show all installed channel.
|When run by a user channels work locally, when run by root they're used as the system-wide channels.

To download the source as specified by the package recipe: <pre>nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A emacs.src</pre>
The patched source is usually not a derivation itself, but can be produced for most packages with the following command: <pre>nix-shell '<nixpkgs>' -A emacs\
   --command 'unpackPhase; patchPhase'</pre>
