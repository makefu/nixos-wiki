== Enabling Bluetooth in NixOS ==

Enabling Bluetooth is as simple as putting this in your configuration.nix:

<pre>
hardware.bluetooth.enable = true;
</pre>

== Bluez 5 ==
<del>To use Bluez 5, you need something like this in your Nixpkgs config (in your <code>~/.nixpkgs/config.nix</code>):</del>

Bluez5 is now the default version (as of 2017-06-30)

<pre>
pkgs : {
  packageOverrides = pkgs : {
    bluez = pkgs.bluez5;
  }
}
</pre>
