== Enabling Bluetooth in NixOS ==

Enabling Bluetooth is as simple as putting this in your configuration.nix:

<pre>
hardware.bluetooth.enable = true;
</pre>

== Bluez 4 ==

This is the default for now (as of August 2013), as KDE 4.10 and Pulseaudio 4.0 do not yet support Bluez 5.

== Bluez 5 ==

To use Bluez 5, you need something like this in your Nixpkgs config (in your <code>~/.nixpkgs/config.nix</code>):

<pre>
pkgs : {
  packageOverrides = pkgs : {
    bluez = pkgs.bluez5;
  }
}
</pre>
