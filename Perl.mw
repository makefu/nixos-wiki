= How to add something from CPAN to nixpkgs =

* Use the nix-generate-from-cpan.pl script (see nixpkgs/maintainers/scripts/) to generate something appropriate.  Example usage: nix-generate-from-cpan.pl Devel::REPL
* After reviewing the result from the previous step and making appropriate modifications, add it to <code>pkgs/top-level/perl-packages.nix</code>.  Note that some things use <code>buildPerlPackage</code> while some use <code>buildPerlModule</code>.  Also note the mostly-followed naming convention as well as the mostly-followed alphabetical ordering. There are plenty of examples in perl-packages.nix -- use the source, Luke!
* Build and test.
