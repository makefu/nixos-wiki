== Zotero Firefox add-on ==
The Zotero Firefox add-on works as expected with one caveat; the pdftotext and pdfinfo plugins it needs in order to index and pull metadata from PDFs you wish to add to your library.

The solution, for now, is as follows (this assumes that you have the Zotero plugin installed and configured sans PDF support): '''NB: The symlinks DO NOT survive an update between Firefox versions, so everytime your Firefox is updated you will have to repeat the below process!
'''
In your filesystem navigate to ~/.mozilla/firefox/<profile>/zotero
Create the following symlinks and ensure that they are named EXACTLY as described here:

  ln -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/pdftotext pdftotext-Linux-<architecture> (e.g., pdftotext-Linux-x86_64)
  ln -s /run/current-system/sw/bin/pdfinfo pdfinfo-Linux-<architecture>

Launch Firefox and go to the Zotero add-on preferences; click on the "Search" tab and you should find that both, pdftotext and pdfinfo, are recognized and their version is either "UNKNOWN" or the correct version number. This is trivial and should not deter you. You can now use the PDF metadata retrieval capabilities.
