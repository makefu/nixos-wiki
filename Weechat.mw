''WeeChat'' is an extensible chat client with a command line interface.

== Plugins ==
WeeChat can be extended with plugins, which can be written in a variety of scripting languages. As these plugins may depend on external libraries, we need to take care that those are found by WeeChat. For example the [https://weechat.org/scripts/source/jabber.py.html/ Jabber plugin] depends on the <code>xmpppy</code> python library, which is provided in a separate nix package. To make WeeChat find the library, we can override the <code>weechat</code> nix package and add the dependency as an extra build input, e.g. by changing the <code>~/.nixpkgs/config.nix</code> as follows:

<pre>
{
  packageOverrides = pkgs: rec {
    weechat = pkgs.weechat.override { extraBuildInputs = [ pkgs.xmpppy ]; };
  };
}
</pre>
