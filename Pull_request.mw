== What is a github pull request ? ==
Its a way to tell a github project that you've created some changes.
Maintainers can easily review, comment on and merge your changes.

== How to create a git pull request ==
1) Create a github account and fork nixpks/nixos/... repository. 

2) On you host, create a new remote location:

    # add your github clone as remote location:
    YOUR_GITHUB_NAME=fill-in
    git remote add $YOUR_GITHUB_NAME "git@github.com:$YOUR_GITHUB_NAME/nixpkgs.git"

3)  git commit your change

    git add FILE_LIST # eventually use git add --patch
    git commit

    # verify everything is ok - no unexpected dangling files git does not know about yet:
    git status

4) submitting your change, push to your repository:


    # recommended: create a topic branch, so that this change
    # can be submitted independently from other patches:
    git checkout -tb submit/your-topic-name
    git push $YOUR_GITHUB_NAME submit/your-topic-name

goto gituhb.com/your_name -> create pull request

Why create your own branch? You can follow upstream (master) by running "git merge master".
You can "git commit --amend" fixes and "git push -f" your branch.
You can always switch back to master by "git checkout master".

For long living topic branches you may want to read [[Nixpkgs_and_TopGit]] which allows to squash many changes so that patches will always be easy to review.
